"""InvestigationState on the Cardinal server: publish (put-state) and pull
(get-state), and the client attestation the server stores with a state.

The server checks a published state with the same rules as check() (its
port, in maestro) except one: it holds no session transcripts, so it cannot
verify an owner or agent quote. This client verifies them here, against the
transcripts, and ATTESTS what it verified:

  quotes          {key, role, session, utterance_sha256} for each message
                  quote that verify_quote() accepted. key = quote_key(role,
                  at, quote): what was said, by which role, when.
                  utterance_sha256 hashes the normalized utterance holding
                  it, so a verifier that holds the transcript can confirm it
                  later without trusting this client.
  plan_approvals  {key, session} for each plan approval
                  verify_plan_approval() accepted.

The server accepts an owner-authority claim only when the quote it rests on
is attested (otherwise it fails closed, like check() with no transcript),
and returns every such claim to every reader marked as client-attested,
never as verified. The attestation is only as good as this client: it is
recorded with the key and client that published it.

After a successful publish the server copy is canonical: the caller records
the version / etag it got back, and the next publish names that version
(base_version); a publish based on anything else is refused (409).

A state is addressed by its storyboard (storyboard_id, as in plugin 0.40.0)
or by its Investigation (investigation_id), a server object that exists
before any storyboard does: create_investigation, get_investigation,
attach_storyboard. The investigation's id travels in the request, never in
the state document.

Standard library only.
