"""Automatic session bootstrap: every connected agent session gets an
Investigation and its live Storyboard, with no command, skill or prompt.

At session start (and lazily after a failure) the adapter calls ensure():

  - an existing binding of this session that bootstrapped ok (and belongs
    to the connected org, and is not overridden by an explicit join) is
    reused as it is: no network. Restart, resume and compaction answer
    "what's the storyboard link?" from the binding file.
  - otherwise maestro's ensure-session-investigation, idempotent per (org,
    caller principal, session id): the first call creates the Investigation
    (origin "session", no invented question) and its one Storyboard draft in
    one transaction; every later call (another hook, a retry, a resume on
    another machine with the same key) returns the same pair. With an
    explicit investigation id (CARDINAL_INVESTIGATION_ID) it joins that one
    and never creates an Investigation.
  - the answer is written into the session's binding
    (investigation_events: investigation_id, storyboard_id, view_url,
    investigation_url, org, bootstrap {status: ok}); a binding to the same
    investigation keeps its cursor.

Failure never blocks the session (fail open). It is recorded, never
announced repeatedly: with a binding (an explicit join) in its
`bootstrap` field, without one in <sid>.bootstrap.json, both as
{status: "failed", last_error, retry_after, attempts}. A retry waits for
retry_after: 30 s doubling to 30 min after a network error or a 5xx, the
server's Retry-After (at least 10 min) after a 429, 6 h after a refusal that
retrying cannot fix (401, 403, an unknown investigation). A server without
the route (an older Maestro) records nothing: the session stays unbound, as
before, and the next session start asks again.

Nothing here uploads evidence: the only requests are
ensure-session-investigation and (CLI) set-investigation-question.

Standard library only. ensure() never raises.
