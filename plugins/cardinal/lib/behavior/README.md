# Behavioral Programs in the Cardinal Claude plugin

The installed plugin registers `cardinal-behavior` alongside the existing Cardinal
MCP connection. It derives the authenticated organization route from
`CARDINAL_MCP_URL` and uses the existing `CARDINAL_MCP_API_KEY`. Maestro resolves
the organization's LakeRunner integration and forwards with its server-side
data-plane credential. The plugin never receives that credential. Its scoped MCP
key is not a Query API key and is never sent to a guessed Query API host. Requests
reject redirects so custom authentication headers cannot follow another host.
No model credentials enter the plugin or UDF.
The deployed runtime injects the authorized JEV backend.

The normal Claude workflow is:

1. `get_behavior_sdk`: fetch the deployed SDK artifact and read its real Python
   sources, profiles, CompilePlan schema, and executable examples. LakeRunner
   imports this exact immutable release artifact from the public
   [cardinalhq/behavior-sdk](https://github.com/cardinalhq/behavior-sdk) repository.
   The SDK version, source commit, public artifact URL, and SHA-256 appear in the
   response and are retained with compilation and acceptance. The
   plugin verifies its SHA-256 content address and caches the immutable artifact;
   it contains no independently maintained SDK declarations. The response starts
   with `sdk_directory` and `sdk_files`: exact verified public files materialized
   under the digest cache, so Claude can page through real Python source using
   its normal Read tool even when the complete MCP response is large.
2. Author a candidate from the user's contract, then call `compile_behavior`
   with `description`, `service_name`, `udf_source`, and `compile_plan`. The plugin
   pins the observed SDK, profile, and host runtime identities. The deployed
   compiler checks syntax, imports, public API, and mechanical requirements.
   Up to eight authored `teaching_examples` are optional compiler checks.
3. Call `test_behavior` with the compiled `diagnostic_version`, real `trace_ids`,
   their `service_name`, and an RFC3339 `start`/`end` window of at most one hour.
   Supply `expected_verdicts`, a map from every teaching trace ID to its expected
   MATCH, NON_MATCH, or UNKNOWN verdict. Execution failures return ERROR. The deployed API reads those
   traces through the production catalog and runs the candidate with the same
   production SDK, sandbox, and authorized JEV backend used for population runs.
   Results include actual verdicts, witnesses, Recorder output, and JEV receipts.
   No local evaluator or synthetic replacement trace is used by this tool.
4. Inspect the contract, source, compile receipt, and teaching results. Revise
   and compile again if necessary. The optional `udf_source` on `test_behavior`
   must exactly match the compiled candidate. For example, discover behavior in
   trace A, choose contrasting trace B, and confirm A MATCH/B NON_MATCH before
   acceptance. Teaching examples establish intent, not population accuracy.
   Every test batch is retained in the compilation scope identified by the exact
   description and service name, including failed batches. A repair with the same
   description/service inherits that entire suite. Use `get_behavior_compilation`
   to inspect coverage and `run_behavior_regressions` to replay it in batches of
   at most eight real traces. The replay continues after an ERROR or failed batch.
   A new replay invalidates previous observations for that candidate, preventing
   an interrupted run from silently using earlier passing results.
   Ordinary test batches also reserve their cases before contacting the backend.
   Failed requests and invalid receipts leave missing coverage; an older response
   cannot replace a newer test attempt. Receipt and acceptance updates are
   serialized so concurrent plugin processes preserve the incumbent metadata.
5. `accept_behavior` explicitly accepts the inspected immutable DiagnosticVersion.
   Acceptance requires a real teaching receipt with expected verdicts and binds
   its trace IDs, expected/actual results, compile/JEV receipts, and SDK/profile/
   runtime identities. Identity disagreements fail closed.
   The plugin also verifies every accumulated regression case for that version.
   A latest passing batch cannot hide an older failure or missing case. The
   previously accepted incumbent remains selected on compilation, test, or
   acceptance failure. This development gate does not claim independent
   qualification; the separate blind-audit lifecycle is described below.
6. `execute_behavior` submits the accepted version, `population` (exact service
   name), and RFC3339 `start` and `end` to the authenticated deployed API.
7. Call `next_behavior_result` until a completed receipt appears. Findings expose
   trace ID, verdict, bounded reason, witness references and coverage gaps. A
   running count is progress, not the final population denominator.
8. `get_behavior_execution` inspects durable shard references and bounded JEV
   metadata for a selected trace without advancing the result cursor.
9. `render_storyboard` fetches committed detailed receipts and renders expandable
   evidence from a completed execution. Raw model inputs stay in private host
   artifacts and the Storyboard, outside the tool's compact findings.

SDK artifacts, compiled versions, teaching results, acceptances, and execution
receipts are retained under `~/.cardinal/behavior-executions` by default.
`CARDINAL_BEHAVIOR_OUTPUT_DIR` can select another private directory. The bridge
checks SDK artifact and source hashes, SDK/profile/runtime identities, result
version/UDF/adapter identities, duplicate trace IDs, and completed counts.
Multiple compiled versions can be tested, executed, and inspected after a plugin
restart. Read `get_behavior_sdk` in each authoring session before compiling.

## Canonical compilation components

All reusable authoring and qualification code lives in this plugin's
[`compilation/`](compilation/) package. The deployed SDK compiler and JEV remain
external pinned runtime dependencies. `server.py` supplies MCP transport and
production execution; it inherits the authoring bridge from this package.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `hosted.py` | SDK discovery, deployed compile/test/accept, complete-suite replay |
| `regression.py` | Persistent development cases, receipt checks, accepted incumbent |
| `workflow.py` | Explicit offline compile → challenge → repair → qualify → freeze cycle |
| `engine.py` | Bounded repair, provisional promotion, complete regressions, one hidden audit, freeze and amortized cost |
| `corpus.py` | Source-shaped corpus rendering and independent blind fidelity/gold review |
| `llm.py` | Optional stateless offline model transport and usage receipts |
| `sdk_adapter.py` | Configurable binding to the unchanged SDK compiler, sandbox and embedded JEV |
| `identity.py`, `lifecycle.py` | Input fingerprints, explicit requalification, optional evidence collection |
| `runtime.py` | Frozen-bundle integrity/admission and one unchanged SDK invocation |
| `storage.py`, `files.py` | Immutable execution reservations and private receipt persistence |

The release build includes this entire package with the existing behavior MCP
launcher. No component imports an experiment checkout or assumes a developer's
workspace layout. Historical `behavioral-program-qualification` and
`behavioral-compilation-correctness` artifacts remain sealed research records;
future implementation changes belong here. `compilation/provenance.json`
records the migrated source hashes and unchanged semantic instructions/runtime
methods. This source consolidation does not itself publish or install a release.

For a new offline qualification cycle, import
`compilation.workflow.compile_and_qualify` with `common/behavior` (or the installed
`lib/behavior`) on the Python path. Supply the source/plan, contract/context,
exact SDK documentation, independent role transport, reviewed corpus provider,
pinned SDK adapter, lifecycle fingerprints, dependency files, and an explicit
`Policy`. The SDK adapter receives the existing profile, JEV factory, sandbox,
evidence auditor and identity verifier; it never defines replacement SDK APIs.
The provided corpus renderer supports the original four-span native episode
shape. Supply its native/source schema validators explicitly, or inject a
reviewed corpus provider for another trace shape. No permissive schema fallback
is provided. The repair and review semantic instructions are unchanged.

`compile_and_qualify` returns `QUALIFIED` only after every development case passes
and a previously untouched, independently reviewed audit passes for MATCH,
NON_MATCH and UNKNOWN. Failed audits are terminal for that cycle. Rejected
repairs leave the incumbent unchanged. Successful cycles export an immutable
bundle; incomplete or failed cycles retain their evidence and return
`CANNOT_QUALIFY`. The frozen bundle is not automatically accepted or deployed by
the hosted API. An application supplies its existing trusted admission mechanism.

Qualification costs include authorship, review, challenge, repair, compilation
and SDK test executions. Supply their actual usage rows; unavailable prices or
usage remain unknown. `cost_summary` keeps them separate from steady-state SDK/JEV
execution and amortizes qualification cost as `Q / expected_lifetime_executions`.
The untouched held-out experiment remains a separate evaluation of frozen
programs. Passing teaching or qualification fixtures is not a held-out improvement
claim. No downstream adjudicator corrects production verdicts.

`lifecycle.requalify` starts an explicit new offline cycle with parent lineage
after program, agent, telemetry, contract, SDK or JEV identity changes. It never
mutates the old bundle. Optional `collect_sample` only queues existing evidence
for a future cycle; it performs no inference and is not required for execution.

Hosted development history is scoped to the plugin's private output directory.
Imported older candidates must be recompiled through `compile_behavior` before
new acceptance so that their regression scope is registered. Existing accepted
versions continue executing unchanged. The deployed API still validates its
own acceptance receipt; clients bypassing this plugin do not gain its accumulated
suite guard. Changing the relevant contract starts a distinct development scope;
independent requalification must explicitly record the change and parent lineage.

For explicit deployments, `CARDINAL_BEHAVIOR_CONFIG` or `--config` can name a JSON
configuration; see `config.example.json` for an operator's direct Query API
configuration. `CARDINAL_BEHAVIOR_API_URL` also remains an explicit direct URL
override and reads its matching data-plane credential from `CARDINAL_QUERY_API_KEY`.
It never falls back to the scoped MCP key. Direct JSON configuration can
select its credential with `api_key_env`; it must not reuse a scoped Maestro MCP
key. `headers_file`, if used, must be private
(mode 0600) and contain only supported API authentication headers. Authenticated
normal API calls derive the organization from the existing Cardinal key.

The release build copies canonical `common/behavior` into `lib/behavior`; the
launcher supports both installed plugins and source checkouts. Legacy explicitly
configured `diagnostic_version`/`artifacts` selection remains available for old
receipts, but the normal workflow does not load frozen default artifacts or
require manual registration.

Run focused checks with:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s common/behavior/tests -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_behavior_release.py -v
```

The optional `test_retained_failures.py` replay requires
`CARDINAL_BEHAVIOR_RETAINED_FIXTURES` to point to the sealed qualification workspace.
It executes the three retained failing programs against their complete retained
development suites using this package's SDK adapter and controller, forbids model
backend calls, and uses an explicit deterministic incumbent stand-in. It is a
mechanical regression test, not another qualification experiment.
